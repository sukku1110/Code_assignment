In order to check the traffic coming from the network  we are using pyshark for network 
traffic monitoring since it leverages the powerful capabilities of many other libraries like winpcapy etc. 
This method is reliable and widely used for network analysis. 
pyshark simplifies packet capture and processing in Python, making it easier to integrate with other Python-based applications.

Pre-requisites:
1.Interface Selection: Ensure we replace 'your_network_interface' in start_network_capture() with the actual name of your network interface. 
You can find the interface name by running pyshark.tshark.tshark.get_tshark_interfaces().

2.Running pyshark to capture live packets requires administrative privileges.
